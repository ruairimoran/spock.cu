# Contributing guidelines

_Version: 0.0.1_


## 1. Working with git

### 1.1. General rules

- The `main` branch is locked and no-one can push to it directly
- The main development branch is called `dev`
- All development will take place in branches out of `dev`
- Do not commit big files
- Do not commit autogenerated files
- Avoid committing binary files


### 1.2. Git commits

- Use informative commit messages: "fix stuff" is a bad commit message
- Make several commits as you write code (typically several every day)
- Commits should be _atomic_
- Multi-line git commit messages are encouraged. An example of a good commit message is

```
Implementation of scenario tree factory 

Addresses #101
```

### 1.3. Versioning

- This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
- When a new version is released, we should create a [tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)


### 1.4. Branches and pull requests

- Every branch should address a _specific_ issue or development goal
- Branch names should with either of
    - `feature/` for new developments, including documentation
    - `fix/` for bug fixes
    - `hotfix/` for quick fixes (hotfixes should be _very_ small changes)
- To create a new branch do 

```git
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/123-cholesky-factorisation
```

where the number `123` corresponds to the number of an open issue if there is one (otherwise, just `feature/cholesky-factorisation`).

- After you create a branch, create a PR for your code to be reviewed
- When you create a new PR, make sure that the base branch is `dev` (not `main`), unless you want to create a new release (see below)
- Pull requests must have an adequately detailed description
- Avoid lengthy PRs with lots of changes (each PR should focus on one issue, and we should either close it or merge it in a matter of a few days)
- No PR will be merged to `dev` unless it has been tested (evidence should be provided)
- The branch `dev` will be merged into `main` before making a new release (`CHANGELOG.md` must be updated when doing so)
- All PRs must be reviewed before they can be merged
- When a PR is ready for review, its author should invite _at least_ one of the collaborators to review it
- Do not merge other people's PRs!

**Important:** All invited reviewers should complete their reviews in a timely manner! 


### 1.5. Pull request creation

When you create a new PR, you will see the following template:

> ## Main Changes
> 
> :warning: Before you make a contribution make sure you've read the [**contributing guidelines**](/CONTRIBUTING.md)
> 
> :warning: Do not make a PR to merge into `main`; merge into `dev` instead (unless you are creating a new release)
> 
> Is this a PR about some _specific_ development? If not, don't submit it. 
> 
> Describe the main changes here
> 
> 
> ## Associated Issues
> 
> - Closes #1
> - Addresses #2


You need to **modify it**: e.g., update the **associated issues**. If the PR is not associated with an issue, delete that section.

Lastly, give your PR a meaningful title.

If you have been invited to review a PR:

- Go to "files changed"
- Click on a line to add your comments and select **Add single comment** (not "start a review"). You can use [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for your comments 
- Once you go through all files, complete your review: click on **review changes** (green button at the top-right corner) and either "Approve" or "Request changes"


### 1.6. Issues

Key points:

- If you have found a bug, or you want to request a new feature, create an issue 
- Make sure your bug report is accompanied by a _**minimal** reproducible example_ (MRE)
- When you create an issue, assign it to someone (e.g., yourself)
- Use appropriate labels for your issues
- All issues should be _assigned_ to a team member

When creating an issue for a bug, you will see the following template:

> **Describe the bug**
> A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
> 
> **To Reproduce**
> Steps to reproduce the behavior:
> 1. 
> 2. 
> 3. See error
> 
> **Expected behavior**
> A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
> 
> **Screenshots**
> If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
> 
> **Desktop (please complete the following information):**
>  - OS: [e.g. iOS]
>  - Browser [e.g. chrome, safari]
>  - Version [e.g. 22]
> 
> **Additional context**
> Add any other context about the problem here.

Fill it in and provide adequate information for other people to be able to understand and reproduce the issue.

### 1.7. Conflicts

Sometimes, you may see a message like this in your PR:

<img width="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/QUB-ASL/bzzz/assets/125415/a3bf550d-2d96-41cc-8c96-0e17a9d9e294">

In that case, you need to merge the base branch (usually `dev`) into the branch of the PR<sup>1</sup> and **resolve the conflicts locally** before you push. On [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/about-merge-conflicts) we read 

> Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have **competing commits**, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.

You can read more about conflicts and how to resolve them at https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/resolve-github-merge-conflicts.

<details>
  <summary><sup>1</sup> See how...</summary>
  To merge `dev` into a branch, do 

  ```bash
  # Make sure your local dev is up to date
  git checkout dev
  git pull origin dev

  # Make sure your own branch is up to date
  git checkout fix/123-name-of-branch
  git pull origin fix/123-name-of-branch

  # Merge dev
  git merge dev
  ```

  Needless to say, keep an eye on the messages git gives you. It's a good idea to start with a `git status` (you may have unstaged files).

## 2. Project structure

- Store all:
    - C++ files in the folder `src`
    - Python files in the folder `py`
    - documentation in the folder `docs`
- Do **not** store any important files in the folder `playground` as this will eventually be **removed**



## 3. Coding good practice 

### 3.1. C/C++

Our C++ naming convention is as follows:

- Make sure you use descriptive variable names, that is, `angularVelocity` instead of `w`
- Class and structure names are PascalCase (camel case with first letter uppercase); in most other cases we use camel case as this is the standard in the community
- Preprocessor directives are in "screaming snake case", e.g., `DEBUG_MODE`
- All other variables (e.g., local variables) are camel case, e.g., `angularVelocity`
- Static variables use the prefix `s_`, e.g., `s_staticVariable`
- Global constants use the prefix `c_`, e.g., `c_globalConstant`
- Private class members use the prefix `m_`, e.g., `m_privateVariable`
- Global variables use the prefix `g_`, e.g., `g_globalVariable`
- When it comes to getters and setters we use `foo()` (_not_ `getFoo()`) and `setFoo(val)`

### 3.2. CUDA

Our CUDA naming convention includes the C++ convention, and:

- Variables that live on the device use the prefix `d_`, e.g., `d_dataVariable`
- Prefixes are combined with `d_` by using `x_d_` (where `x_` is the other prefix), e.g., `m_d_privateVariableThatLivesOnDevice`
- Note that variables without the prefix `d_` live on the host

**What goes in a header file:** Declare all public entities. Is a function/method/class/structure needed outside the scope of this file? If not, it does not belong in the header file. Do not put any implementations in the header file - put them in the code files instead.

### 3.2. Python

- Just follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- Make sure you have read the corresponding [naming convention](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)
- Use `virtualenv` to run your Python code

<details>
  <summary>Python tips</summary>

  - Study [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) carefully (and follow it)
  - Classes are `PascalCase`
  - Function/method names are `snake_case`
  - Use an autopep8 formatter in VS code
  - Unused (output) variables are `_like_this`
  - Avoid one-letter or confusing variable names (e.g., use `acceleration` instead of `a`)
  - Should this method be public? Think again! If not, make it a `__private_method()`

</details>

### 3.3. Documentation and comments

- Overall, adequate documentation should be provided to allow anyone to use _and contribute_ to the code, i.e., it must be easy to understand
- Include **all** useful hints and tips. You will forget how something works. You will.
- If you don't know where to include information, add a `README.md` in the _relevant_ folder
- In C++, the code should be documented using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html)-style docstrings
- In Python, the code should be documented using [Sphinx](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html) docstrings

Example of C++ documentation:

```c++
/**
 * @brief computes control action
 *
 * @param systemState state of the system
 *
 * @return control voltage
 */
float controlAction(float systemState);
```

### 3.4. Testing and CI

Continuous integration (CI) has been setup. You can learn more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration).

- Tests must be included in the file `ci/script.sh`. This can be run from the terminal for local testing: `bash ./ci/script.sh`
- C++ tests are written using [googletest](https://google.github.io/googletest/) (does **not** need installed) and built/run using [cmake](https://google.github.io/googletest/quickstart-cmake.html) (does need [installed](https://cmake.org/resources))
- Python tests use [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html). You will need to install **Python3.10** (currently preinstalled on GitHub's Ubuntu runners)



## 4. Markdown

Use [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for your comments, issues, and PRs on GitHub. It is particularly important to use markdown for inline code (e.g., `variableName`) and code blocks.
