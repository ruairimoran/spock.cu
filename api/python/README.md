## Hints and tips
- If running `pip` at top level, replace `.` with `api/python`.
- Once you have created and activated a python(-tk) virtual environment, you can install the basic dependencies with `pip install .`.
- For drawing scenario trees, you will need python-tk and run `pip install '.[draw]'`.
- For running examples and tests, use `pip install '.[all]'`.
